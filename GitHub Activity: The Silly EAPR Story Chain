#Objective:
As a team, collaboratively build a silly story about EAPR using GitHub! 
Each person will add one line to the story by creating a branch, making a commit, opening a pull request, and having it reviewed. 
The reviewer will then repeat the process and pick someone new. 
We’ll go until everyone’s added their piece to the story.
